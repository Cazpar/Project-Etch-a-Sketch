# The Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch

This is an implementation of The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The Etch-a-Sketch is a drawing toy that allows users to draw and erase on a grid. This implementation allows users to adjust the size of the grid and choose between drawing in black or in a chosen color.

## Usage

To use the Etch-a-Sketch, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser or go to [The live preview](https://cazpar.github.io/Project-Etch-a-Sketch/). Use the sliders to adjust the size of the grid and choose between drawing in black or in random colors. Then, use your mouse to draw on the grid.

## Credits

This implementation was created by Cazpar as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The original project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).
